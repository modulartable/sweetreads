# Sweet Reads

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and built with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) and used [Redux-Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for state-managment.  The project was styled with vanilla CSS.


## The backstory

Sweet Reads was a business idea that my wife, Lauren, had to merge two things we love: baked goods, and good books.  

## Functionality

The website is a mockup that explains the fictional background of Sweet Reads, it's crew, and allows users to place orders for pick-up and payment in-person.  The website utilizes local storage to persist users' cart information and requires users input a name and phone number to place their order.
